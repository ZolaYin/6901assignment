# 1. How many earthquakes are listed in the table?

wc -l signif.txt.tsv
5959 signif.txt.tsv

# 2. How many columns are in the table?

head -n 1 signif.txt.tsv | tr '\t' '\n' | wc -l
47

# 3. Use the cut command to create a new file that just has the data from the columns for YEAR, EQ_PRIMARY and COUNTRY. Hint: you can get the column numbers by using the head command to view the first row and then visually count the column numbers for the above fields (there is also a unix command to do this, but we didn't cover it in class). Call the new data file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv'. You can use 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv' for the rest of the exercises below.

cut -f3,10,18 signif.txt.tsv > Year_Mag_Country.tsv

# 4. EQ_PRIMARY is the assigned earthquake magnitude. With your new file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv', sort the data based on the numeric value of the EQ_PRIMARY column, then list the lines for the top ten largest earthquakes.

sort -k2 -nr Year_Mag_Country.tsv | head -n10
1960     9.5    CHILE
1964     9.2    USA
2011     9.1    JAPAN
2004     9.1    INDONESIA
1952     9.0    RUSSIA
1700     9.0    USA
2010     8.8    CHILE
1812     8.8    USA
1716     8.8    PERU
1965     8.7    USA

# 5. How many unique countries are listed in the database? Use cut,sort,uniq, wc and a few pipes | to form a single expression that answers this question.

cut -f3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv |sort | uniq | wc -l
154

# 6. Use the grep command to count how many earthquakes in the database are located in the USA or USA TERRITORY

grep -E 'USA|USA TERRITORY' Year_Mag_Country.tsv | wc -l
294

# 7. Expanding on the previous exercise, refine your command sequence so that it only counts earthquakes in the USA and not ones in USA TERRITORY. Hint: use the -v argument with grep and you may need to call grep more than once.

# 8. Compute the total number of earthquakes in each country and then display the top ten countries along with the number of earthquakes. Hint: this can be done with a command sequence similar to exercise 5, but requires a specific argument to be used with uniq.

cut -f3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n10
    579 CHINA
    400 JAPAN
    365 IRAN
    363 INDONESIA
    324 ITALY
    319 TURKEY
    259 GREECE
    255 USA
    207 PHILIPPINES
    193 MEXICO

# 9. Create a shell script named countEq.sh that returns the total number of earthquakes for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Hint: see the Shell Script notes and use the special variable $1. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country USA.

Shell:
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 COUNTRY_NAME"
    exit 1
fi

country="$1"
grep -w "$country" Year_Mag_Country.tsv | wc -l
Terminal:
chmod +x countEq.sh
./countEq.sh USA
294

# 10. Create a shell script named countEq_getLargestEq.sh that returns both the total number of earthquakes AND the largest earthquake for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Use the echo command before each command to create labels for each returned value. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country CHILE.

Shell:
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 COUNTRY_NAME"
    exit 1
fi
#country name
country="$1"
#number of earthquakes
echo "Total number of earthquakes in $country:"
grep -w "$country" Year_Mag_Country.tsv | wc -l
# the largest earthquake
echo "Largest earthquake magnitude in $country:"
grep -w "$country" Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort -t$'\t' -k2 -nr | head -n1 | cut -f2

Terminal:
chmod +x countEq_getLargestEq.sh
qy2307@chopin:~$ ./countEq_getLargestEq.sh CHILE
Total number of earthquakes in CHILE:
192
Largest earthquake magnitude in CHILE:
 9.5

# 11. Compute the total number of earthquakes each year and then output a sorted list of the top ten years with the most earthquakes. Paste your command and the top ten list below.

cut -f1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n10
     78 2004
     77 2008
     72 2003
     67 2007
     62 2010
     61 2006
     60 2009
     60 2005
     60 2002
